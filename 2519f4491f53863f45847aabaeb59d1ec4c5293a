      "message": "I think we can just remove the condition related to LOCAL_CLANG.\n* elfutils is unlikely to be compiled by Clang in the near future, due to missing support of nested functions.\n* If it can be compiled by both Clang and gcc, we might not define LOCAL_CLANG to true or false at all. So condition on it is unreliable.\n* no-unused-but-set-variable is now a gcc flag and is explicitly filtered out in build/core/clang/config.mk. So it should be okay to add this flag to LOCAL_CFLAGS unconditionally.\nOn the other hand, I hope this is not going to trigger too many warngins and changes in the external source.",
