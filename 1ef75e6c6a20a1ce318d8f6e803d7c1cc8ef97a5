      "message": "It\u0027s a bit complicated to unwind this, but I think I figured it out.\n\nIn older versions of elfutils, the include directory put various files directly under include/elfutuils, and programs were supposed to \"#include \u003celfutils/libdwfl.h\u003e\". But in newer versions, the directory has been split up into libdw, libdwfl, libelf, etc. So now you\u0027re supposed to just \"#include \u003clibdwfl.h\u003e\"\n\nThe rest of the Android platform only uses libelf headers, not libdw or libdwfl. So the libelf/Android.bp does the job. But igt-gpu-tools hard-codes the \"#include \u003celfutils/libdwfl.h\u003e\". /usr/include/elfutils still seems to be a thing in Debian, too.\n\nSo I think this change is correct. The only other way to do fix it would be to export libdw/libdwfl with additional Android.bp, and then patch igt-gpu-tools to eliminate the elfutils/ prefix.",
